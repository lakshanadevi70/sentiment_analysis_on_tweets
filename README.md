# sentiment_analysis_on_tweets 🐦🧠

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on a small collection of tweets to understand public opinion by classifying emotions expressed in text as Positive, Neutral, or Negative. It uses popular Python NLP libraries like TextBlob or VADER to analyze tweet sentiment. 

##🛠 Tools & Technologies
    - Python
    - Pandas (for data handling)
    - TextBlob — a simple Python library that provides sentiment polarity scores
    - VADER — a rule-based sentiment analyzer optimized for social media text 

## 📈 Key Steps
   -  Collect a small dataset of tweets (either manually or by using the Twitter API).
   -  Clean the tweet text (e.g., remove URLs, mentions, emojis).
   -  Apply sentiment analysis using TextBlob or VADER to assign sentiment scores.
   -  Classify tweets as Positive, Neutral, or Negative based on polarity values. 

## 🎯 Goal
